# Sites scrapper

This project uses [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to scrap registered sites for [Algolia](https://algolia.com).

## Sites

* [`inteach.io/blog`](https://inteach.io/blog): InTeach's blog.
* [`docs.inteach.io`](https://docs.inteach.io): InTeach's documentation website.


## Secondary tasks

This project is also used to send a webhook event to _Netlify_ in order to build the blog. It allows us to program blog posts in hugo.
